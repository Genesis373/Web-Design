            <h2>Poaching Problems</h2>
            <p>While black rhinos are incredible creatures, they are also critically endangered as a result of poaching and organized crime. They are sometimes hunted for illegal sport, but the primary reason that they are illegally hunted is because of their most prominant feature: their horn. Rhino horns are made up of keratin, which is the same substance that our fingernails and toenails are made from. Their horns have even been known to cure cancer! But due to the constant hunting and illegal poaching, the black rhino population has plummeted over the years. Efforts to protect them have kept them from extinction, but today, they number at just over 5000.<p>
            <p>Over a hundred years ago, it was not uncommon to see black rhinos in sub-Saharan Africa; in fact, it was very difficult to not encounter dozens of them in a single day. Unfortunately, due due to the relentless hunting of them by European settlers, there were only about 70,00 black rhinos on the continent of Africa. When poaching of them began on a large scale, around 96% of all black rhinos were wiped out, leaving only 2,475 as the sole survivors. Thanks to successful conservation efforts, however, their numbers have been climbing at a slow-yet-steady rate.</p>

            <p>There are several ways to protect black rhinoceros from poaching rings that are constantly put into practice. Most black rhinos have been put onto nature reserves, and a few are put into open-field zoos, where they are guarded through many anti-poaching efforts. Another method used to discourage hunting is through very careful horn removal. This is different from poaching as it cuts off most of the top of the horn and not all of it. While the horn will grow back over time, this discourages poaching, as a hornless black rhino is not worth the effort to hunt and kill.</p>
