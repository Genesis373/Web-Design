   <h2>What are diamonds?</h2>
   <p>Out of all the world's precious stones the diamnond is the most recognizable of all of them. These brilliant stones are most commonly known for being used in jewelry, but this is just one of the many uses they have. Due to them being the hardest natural material on earth, they are a vital component for industrial jobs such as cutting, drilling, and even manufacturing. They are also one of the rarest gemstones in the world and, as such, are very expensive.</p>
